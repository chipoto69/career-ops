  // template also requires Risk Summary, H) Draft Application Answers and
  // Keywords extracted. The `EXACTLY` carried the real instruction, so nothing
  // broke, which is precisely why the drift was invisible. The mode file is the
  // one source of truth for which sections exist; naming a subset here can only
  // ever go stale, never help.
  //
  // And it does not let a failed fetch become a scored report. WebFetch returns
  // 200 with a login wall, a lazy-loaded shell carrying no description (#2619),
  // an expired-ad page or a bot challenge, and none of that announces itself as
  // an error. An agent handed that text will happily grade it: the output is a
  // confident A–F evaluation of a login screen, shaped exactly like a real one.

  // The REFUSAL IS NOT THIS PROMPT'S POLICY, and saying so matters: the web is a
  // view over the core's modes, never a parallel engine. modes/oferta.md step 3
  // already rules that a posting which "appears closed" stops before Block A with
  // no evaluation, report or CV, and modes/pipeline.md's LinkedIn note already
  // says never to treat a login wall or partial shell as a verified JD. Both were
  // written for the interactive path; headless just never had the case spelled
  // out. So this points AT those rules rather than inventing a third one — if the
  // core changes its mind, this follows instead of contradicting it.
