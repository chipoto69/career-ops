/**
 * Resolve an npm-generated Windows shim to something `spawn()` can launch
 * without a shell (#2375).
 *
 * Why this exists: since the CVE-2024-27980 patches, `spawn()` of a `.cmd`/`.bat`
 * without `shell: true` throws EINVAL, the extensionless sh shim gives ENOENT
 * and the `.ps1` gives EFTYPE. npm on Windows installs exactly those three
 * shims into the global prefix (`%APPDATA%\npm`), so every npm-installed CLI is
 * unspawnable by path — while the real entrypoint they wrap is fine. Reading the
 * shim and launching its target directly sidesteps all three failures without
 * ever enabling `shell: true`, so prompt text stays an argv element and never
 * meets a command interpreter.
 *
 * Both shim shapes npm writes are handled:
 *   - native target:  `"%dp0%\node_modules\<pkg>\bin\tool.exe" %*`  → launch the .exe
 *   - script target:  `"%_prog%" "%dp0%\node_modules\<pkg>\bin\cli.js" %*` → launch
 *     `process.execPath` with the script as argv[0]
 * The `.cmd` sibling is preferred as the source of truth (it is always present
 * next to the other two); the sh shim is the fallback.
 *
 * Anything that is not an npm shim — a real `.exe`, a POSIX binary, a path we
 * cannot read — passes through untouched, so non-Windows platforms and native
 * installs are unaffected by construction.
 *
 * @param {string} binPath  Path as found by the CLI resolver.
 * @param {{ platform?: string, execPath?: string, readFile?: (p: string) => string, exists?: (p: string) => boolean }} [deps]
 *   Injectable for tests; defaults to the real process and filesystem.
 * @returns {{ file: string, prefixArgs: string[] }}  What to spawn, and any argv to prepend.
