// tests/verify-portals-rejected-alternate.test.mjs — a live alternate board that
// the identity gate refuses must be REPORTED, not silently dropped (#4230).
//
// Before this, `discoverAlternates` discarded an unconfirmed candidate with a bare
// `continue`, so a company whose slug had migrated to another ATS looked exactly
// like one whose board was simply dead. The gate itself stays strict: nothing here
// is ever adopted, and `fix-slugs` still refuses to write it.
//
// Driven through `verifyCompanies`, the exported seam that accepts an injected
// fetchJson/fetchText — the same seam tests/verify-portals-job-boards.test.mjs uses.
// Ashby's owner check reads HTML (`ownerKind: 'html'`), so the fixture supplies a
// title, not JSON.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/verify-portals-rejected-alternate.test.mjs
