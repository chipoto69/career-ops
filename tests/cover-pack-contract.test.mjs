// tests/cover-pack-contract.test.mjs — core must fill every slot the pack
// cover-letter contract declares.
//
// Nothing rendered a pack-shaped template through core before this, which is how
// the contract and the renderer drifted apart twice without a red test:
// {{RECIPIENT_BLOCK}} was declared and never filled, so every pack cover template
// died at substitution; and {{DATELINE}} was declared as the date while the
// renderer joined company and city into it, so a pack letter printed the company
// twice.
//
// The gap was structural. validateTemplate demands 3 placeholders for kind=cover
// while the contract declares 14, and tests/template-packs.test.mjs proves a pack
// RESOLVES without ever rendering one. Every other cover suite builds its own
// inline fixture carrying just the slots that test needs, so none of them can see
// a slot core forgot.
//
// CONTRACT_SLOTS below is the list from the pack authoring docs, transcribed. It
// is deliberately a literal rather than something derived from the renderer: a
// list read out of generate-cover-letter.mjs would agree with itself no matter
// what the contract says, which is exactly the check that was missing.
