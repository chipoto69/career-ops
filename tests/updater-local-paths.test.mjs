/**
 * updater-local-paths.test.mjs — coverage for the local user-paths
 * declaration file (#2421).
 *
 * A fork that keeps its own files (a nightly runner, an .mcp.json, a
 * .gitattributes) has no supported way to say "this file is mine": the only
 * lever is USER_PATHS, which lives inside update-system.mjs — the very file
 * `apply` overwrites and git re-merges on every sync. The declaration file
 * moves that statement OUT of the system layer.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the property that makes the feature safe to ship:
 * absent file changes nothing, a declaration is honored, and one that would
 * stop a system file from updating says so out loud instead of doing it quietly.
